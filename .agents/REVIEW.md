# Architectural and Security Review

## Architectural Concerns

### 1. Module Structure
**Current State**: The project has a clean separation between CLI commands and core logic.

**Observations:**
- Good use of Typer framework for CLI management
- Custom `TyperAlias` class provides command aliasing functionality
- Modular design with separate files for each command

**Recommendations:**
- Keep API client logic separate from CLI commands for better testability
- Consider adding a service layer between CLI and API for complex operations
- Implement proper logging throughout the application

### 2. Configuration Management
**Current State**: Well-implemented configuration system using JSON files.

**Strengths:**
- Centralized configuration in `~/.config/c7fetch/`
- Support for environment variables (apikey_env)
- Placeholder replacement system for dynamic values
- Default values with override capability

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Add configuration validation (e.g., valid URL formats, numeric ranges)
- Consider supporting multiple configuration profiles
- Add configuration migration support for future schema changes

### 3. Error Handling
**Current State**: Basic error handling with Typer's Exit mechanism.

**Needs Implementation:**
- Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- Retry logic for transient network errors
- User-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- Proper logging of errors for debugging

### 4. Performance Considerations
**Potential Issues:**
- No apparent caching mechanism for API responses
- Sequential processing for multiple searches/fetches
- Large file handling could consume significant memory

**Recommendations:**
- Implement response caching with TTL
- Add parallel processing for batch operations
- Use streaming for large file downloads
- Add progress indicators for long-running operations

## Security Concerns

### 1. API Key Management
**Critical**: API keys need secure handling.

**Current Implementation:**
- Supports both direct storage and environment variable reference
- Stored in user config directory

**Security Recommendations:**
- **NEVER** log or print API keys in any output
- Add warning when storing API key directly in config
- Prefer environment variable approach
- Consider integration with system keychains (macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- Implement secure deletion of old configuration files

### 2. File System Security
**Concerns:**
- Path traversal vulnerabilities in file operations
- Overwrite protection currently optional

**Recommendations:**
- Validate and sanitize all file paths
- Use `pathvalidate` library consistently (mentioned in README but not yet imported)
- Implement proper permission checks before file operations
- Add file size limits to prevent disk exhaustion
- Sanitize filenames from API responses

### 3. Network Security
**Considerations:**
- HTTPS should be enforced for all API communications
- Certificate validation must not be disabled
- User-Agent should not leak sensitive information

**Recommendations:**
- Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher
- Implement certificate pinning for Context7 API
- Add request timeout to prevent hanging
- Sanitize all data from API responses before use

### 4. Input Validation
**Critical Areas:**
- Search queries could contain injection attempts
- File paths need validation
- Configuration values need type checking

**Recommendations:**
- Sanitize search queries before API calls
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries if any database operations are added
- Implement rate limiting for API calls

### 5. Data Privacy
**Concerns:**
- Search history could reveal sensitive information
- Cached documents might contain proprietary data

**Recommendations:**
- Add option to disable search history
- Implement secure deletion for sensitive files
- Add data retention policies
- Consider encryption for cached content

## Code Quality Observations

### Positive Aspects
- Clean code structure
- Good use of type hints (could be expanded)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modular design

### Areas for Improvement
- Add comprehensive docstrings
- Implement unit tests
- Add integration tests
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Add code coverage requirements
- Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality

## Dependencies Review
**Current Dependencies:**
- `requests`: Well-maintained, secure
- `typer`: Modern CLI framework, good choice
- `rich`: For terminal formatting, safe

**Missing Dependencies:**
- `pathvalidate`: Mentioned in README but not in pyproject.toml
- Consider adding `pytest` for testing
- Consider adding `python-dotenv` for env file support

## Compliance and Best Practices

### Logging
- Implement structured logging
- Never log sensitive data (API keys, user data)
- Add log rotation
- Different log levels for different environments

### Documentation
- Add API documentation
- Include security guidelines for users
- Document configuration options thoroughly
- Add troubleshooting guide

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all API methods
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Security tests for input validation
- Performance tests for large operations

## Priority Security Actions

1. **Immediate**:
   - Add pathvalidate dependency
   - Implement API key masking in all outputs
   - Add input validation for all user inputs

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add request timeouts
   - Set up basic test suite

3. **Long-term**:
   - Consider encryption for stored data
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
